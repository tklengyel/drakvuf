# Note that the GPL places important restrictions on "derivative works",  #
# yet it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid   #
# misunderstandings, we interpret that term as broadly as copyright law   #
# allows.  For example, we consider an application to constitute a        #
# derivative work for the purpose of this license if it does any of the   #
# following with any software or content covered by this license          #
# ("Covered Software"):                                                   #
#                                                                         #
# o Integrates source code from Covered Software.                         #
#                                                                         #
# o Reads or includes copyrighted data files.                             #
#                                                                         #
# o Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the    #
# results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which will #
# execute anything you tell them to).                                     #
#                                                                         #
# o Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer.  The #
# installers produced by InstallShield are an example of this.  Including #
# DRAKVUF with other software in compressed or archival form does not     #
# trigger this provision, provided appropriate open source decompression  #
# or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.  For the    #
# purposes of this license, an installer is considered to include Covered #
# Software even if it actually retrieves a copy of Covered Software from  #
# another source during runtime (such as by downloading it from the       #
# Internet).                                                              #
#                                                                         #
# o Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any of the  #
# above.                                                                  #
#                                                                         #
# o Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above.  #
#                                                                         #
# This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation  #
# of derived works with some common examples.  Other people may interpret #
# the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to   #
# the GPL that we apply to Covered Software.  Works which meet any of     #
# these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license,      #
# particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing      #
# source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole.    #
#                                                                         #
# Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works,    #
# must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including #
# obeying all GPL rules and restrictions.  For example, source code of    #
# the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be         #
# allowed.  All GPL references to "this License", are to be treated as    #
# including the terms and conditions of this license text as well.        #
#                                                                         #
# Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered     #
# Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL #
# software.  The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must   #
# be included as well.  This license is incompatible with some other open #
# source licenses as well.  In some cases we can relicense portions of    #
# DRAKVUF or grant special permissions to use it in other open source     #
# software.  Please contact tamas.k.lengyel@gmail.com with any such       #
# requests.  Similarly, we don't incorporate incompatible open source     #
# software into Covered Software without special permission from the      #
# copyright holders.                                                      #
#                                                                         #
# If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using     #
# DRAKVUF in other works, are happy to help.  As mentioned above,         #
# alternative license can be requested from the author to integrate       #
# DRAKVUF into proprietary applications and appliances.  Please email     #
# tamas.k.lengyel@gmail.com for further information.                      #
#                                                                         #
# If you have received a written license agreement or contract for        #
# Covered Software stating terms other than these, you may choose to use  #
# and redistribute Covered Software under those terms instead of these.   #
#                                                                         #
# Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a     #
# right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it. #
# This also allows you to audit the software for security holes.          #
#                                                                         #
# Source code also allows you to port DRAKVUF to new platforms, fix bugs, #
# and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to submit your changes #
# on https://github.com/tklengyel/drakvuf, or by other methods.           #
# By sending these changes, it is understood (unless you specify          #
# otherwise) that you are offering unlimited, non-exclusive right to      #
# reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  DRAKVUF will always be          #
# available Open Source, but this is important because the inability to   #
# relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free Software  #
# projects (such as KDE and NASM).                                        #
# To specify special license conditions of your contributions, just say   #
# so when you send them.                                                  #
#                                                                         #
