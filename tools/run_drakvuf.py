# This program is free software; you may redistribute and/or modify it   #

# CLARIFICATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN.  This guarantees your  #

#                                                                        #
# Note that the GPL places important restrictions on "derivative works", #
# yet it does not provide a detailed definition of that term.  To avoid  #
# misunderstandings, we interpret that term as broadly as copyright law  #
# allows.  For example, we consider an application to constitute a       #
# derivative work for the purpose of this license if it does any of the  #
# following with any software or content covered by this license         #
# ("Covered Software"):                                                  #
#                                                                        #
# o Integrates source code from Covered Software.                        #
#                                                                        #
# o Reads or includes copyrighted data files.                            #
#                                                                        #
# o Is designed specifically to execute Covered Software and parse the   #
# results (as opposed to typical shell or execution-menu apps, which will#
# execute anything you tell them to).                                    #
#                                                                        #
# o Includes Covered Software in a proprietary executable installer.  The#
# installers produced by InstallShield are an example of this.  Including#
# DRAKVUF with other software in compressed or archival form does not    #
# trigger this provision, provided appropriate open source decompression #
# or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.  For the   #
# purposes of this license, an installer is considered to include Covered#
# Software even if it actually retrieves a copy of Covered Software from #
# another source during runtime (such as by downloading it from the      #
# Internet).                                                             #
#                                                                        #
# o Links (statically or dynamically) to a library which does any of the #
# above.                                                                 #
#                                                                        #
# o Executes a helper program, module, or script to do any of the above. #
#                                                                        #
# This list is not exclusive, but is meant to clarify our interpretation #
# of derived works with some common examples.  Other people may interpret#
# the plain GPL differently, so we consider this a special exception to  #
# the GPL that we apply to Covered Software.  Works which meet any of    #
# these conditions must conform to all of the terms of this license,     #
# particularly including the GPL Section 3 requirements of providing     #
# source code and allowing free redistribution of the work as a whole.   #
#                                                                        #
# Any redistribution of Covered Software, including any derived works,   #
# must obey and carry forward all of the terms of this license, including#
# obeying all GPL rules and restrictions.  For example, source code of   #
# the whole work must be provided and free redistribution must be        #
# allowed.  All GPL references to "this License", are to be treated as   #
# including the terms and conditions of this license text as well.       #
#                                                                        #
# Because this license imposes special exceptions to the GPL, Covered    #
# Work may not be combined (even as part of a larger work) with plain GPL#
# software.  The terms, conditions, and exceptions of this license must  #
# be included as well.  This license is incompatible with some other open#
# source licenses as well.  In some cases we can relicense portions of   #
# DRAKVUF or grant special permissions to use it in other open source    #
# software.  Please contact tamas.k.lengyel@gmail.com with any such      #
# requests.  Similarly, we don't incorporate incompatible open source    #
# software into Covered Software without special permission from the     #
# copyright holders.                                                     #
#                                                                        #
# If you have any questions about the licensing restrictions on using    #
# DRAKVUF in other works, are happy to help.  As mentioned above,        #
# alternative license can be requested from the author to integrate      #
# DRAKVUF into proprietary applications and appliances.  Please email    #
# tamas.k.lengyel@gmail.com for further information.                     #
#                                                                        #
# If you have received a written license agreement or contract for       #
# Covered Software stating terms other than these, you may choose to use #
# and redistribute Covered Software under those terms instead of these.  #
#                                                                        #
# Source is provided to this software because we believe users have a    #
# right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they run it.#
# This also allows you to audit the software for security holes.         #
#                                                                        #
# Source code also allows you to port DRAKVUF to new platforms, fix bugs,#
# and add new features.  You are highly encouraged to submit your changes#
# on https://github.com/tklengyel/drakvuf, or by other methods.          #
# By sending these changes, it is understood (unless you specify         #
# otherwise) that you are offering unlimited, non-exclusive right to     #
# reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  DRAKVUF will always be         #
# available Open Source, but this is important because the inability to  #
# relicense code has caused devastating problems for other Free Software #
# projects (such as KDE and NASM).                                       #
# To specify special license conditions of your contributions, just say  #
# so when you send them.                                                 #
#                                                                        #
